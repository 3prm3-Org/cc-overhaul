# What is this?
This pack is the  **Overhaul** pack; a project by 3prm3 which overhauls (get it?) CC's textures and models.
# How do I get it?
Click the green "code" button and then click download zip.
# Is CC (Computercraft) required?
Yes! This is a texture pack for CC and as such requires it to work.
